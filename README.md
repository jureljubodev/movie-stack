# React + TypeScript + Vite
# MOVIE STACK APP


I used Vite to set up React + Typescript + Vite app with SWC (Speed Web Compiler) for better performance.

How to run?

If your reading this, you probably managed to un-zip the file I sent... After that cd into movie-stack
folder in your terminal and run 

"npm run dev"

Server should be running on http://localhost:5173/


PS: 

If you managed to figure out the error that is stopping me from displaying "Favorite" section, let me know, I've
been trying to solve it for a whole day and still haven't figured it out...

I've had about 2 days to make this, I know styling and design can be improved on, as well as the rest of the code,
but still, I want to be on time, so I'm sending this to you, hoping you see the potential...

Thank you once again for the opportunity!
