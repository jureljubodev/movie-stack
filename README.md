# Movie Stack App


I used Vite to set up React + Typescript + Vite app with SWC (Speed Web Compiler) for better performance.

## How to run?

Navigate into movie-stack folder:

    cd movie-stack
      
Install dependencies:

    npm install

Run the development server:

    npm run dev

Server should be running on http://localhost:5173/

## Live deploy
Deploy using Netlify: 
https://651459abd9668b0ec841480a--dashing-kitsune-e7cc0e.netlify.app/

# Changes:

1. Used styled-components for styling and design
2. _HorizontalContainerGENRE_ for specific genres simplified into singular _HorizontalContainer_ component
3. Used RTK Query and Redux to fetch data from API and store searchQuery into store
4. Fixed "Favorites" functionality with local storage
5. Added DropDown component when searching for movies
6. Fixed empty posters error
7. Added favorite button to MovieCard component (the little star next to movie poster)
8. Added .env variables into the project for safely storing private data

### Other minor changes were made

## PS

Hopefully this has shown you my ability to adjust and learn new concepts quickly, I'm looking forward to your reply.
